An analysis of the colors present in Google Image search results for common emotions.

The emotions analyzed were Robert Plutchik's 8 Primary Emotions. 
Images were gathered via a program called [Bulk Image Downloader](http://bulkimagedownloader.com/).
There were 216 colors used as the color categories, decided as every possible combination of the hex values [00, 33, 66, 99, CC, FF] in an RGB 3-tuple.

The Python code here saves the result to an SQLite database and includes a function for creating a database, but CSV database dumps have been included in the CSV folder for easy access to the data.
